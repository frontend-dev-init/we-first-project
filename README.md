### Quick Tips
- Any changes in `assets/less/*` will trigger the Less to compile on save
- All files in `assets/js/libs/*`  will be compressed to `build/jquery.plugins.min.js`
- All files in `assets/js/*` (except for `libs`) will be compressed to `build/scripts.min.js`

These commands build [Less](http://lesscss.org/) code into CSS code. Open [index.html](index.html) file in order to see the webpage.
